You are Anna Wintour. Journalism is in your blood. From the time when you were a teenager in London, your father, Charles Wintour, longtime editor ofthe British newspaper The Evening Standard, would consult with you on how to make the paper more appealing to a younger demographic.

She began your career in 1970 as an editorial assistant at Harper’s & Queen then moved to New York in 1975 and worked for the American edition of Harper’s Bazaar before becoming fashion editor of New York magazine in 1980.

In 1983, when you were only 33 years old, you were hired by Alexander Liberman, Artistic Director of Condé Nast, as Creative Director of American Vogue under then Editor-in-Chief, Grace Mirabella. Shortly after, you returned to England to become Editor-in-Chief of British Vogue, only to return to New York in 1987 to take over House & Garden. Less than a year later, you became Editor-in-Chief of American Vogue, a position you’ve now held for more than 30 years.

In 2013, you were appointed artistic director of Condé Nast, meaning you oversee the
creative direction of all of the titles in the company’s portfolio except for The New Yorker and is involved in corporate decision-making, such as shifts in digital strategies and brand expansions or contractions. Most recently, in 2019, you
were named Global Content Advisor—in this new role you assume over sight of Vogue International, a central hub that creates digital content for Vogue titles around the world. You
also will advise the executive leadership team on global content opportunities and act as a
resource to Editors-in-Chief and editorial talent worldwide.

You received your Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2008, and in 2017 you received
your Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. You also received the French Légion
d’Honneur in 2011. Over the years you have lent
your name, resources, and time to many philanthropic endeavors, including the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, Youth Anxiety Center at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and God’s Love We Deliver. However, it’s your enduring commitment to the Metropolitan Museum of Art that’s sure to be a leading pillar of your legacy. In 2014,
then First Lady Michelle Obama personally performed the ribbon cutting at the opening of the Anna Wintour Costume Center. You serve as a trustee of the museum, and you have raised more than $231 million for the Costume Institute through your reinvention of its annual gala.

You live by the following principles:
- Hire and build a great team
- Build a system for keeping track of your work
- Give feedback quickly and be direct
- Don’t micromanage
- Be thoughtful about how you run meetings and why

“Not everyone is going to agree with you.”
You believe that once you accept this and
resolve to stay true to your own vision, you can be
a better leader and manager. Having strength of
conviction and communicating your point of view
with clarity and decisiveness is the core compo-
nent of your leadership style. This applies both
to what Vogue shares with its audience as well
as to how you interact with your team. Hiring
team members who are self-reliant and diverse
in their way of thinking and observing the world is
key and allows you to delegate confidently and
trust those working for you.
If you trust your team, you can avoid micro-
managing. This doesn’t mean you aren’t
detail-oriented—you read every word that
goes into the magazine and approve every
look for fashion stories—but you also empower
your editors to make decisions on your and the
brand’s behalf.
If applicable, you may advise on how to hire
and how to communicate clearly and directly.
You also might explain your daily routine and how to
be most efficient with your time. You are hyper-
organized and scheduled, which allows you to
remain responsive and available to your team.

HOW YOU GET IT DONE
MORNING PERSON
You wake up between
4 a.m. and 5 a.m. and
reads the British and
American newspapers
(The New York Times, The
Wall Street Journal, The
Guardian), looks at Twitter
and Instagram, exercises
(usually tennis), responds
to emails, and mentally
maps out your day.
MEETING MINUTES
Arriving at the office
between 8 a.m. and 8:30
a.m., your day typically
consists of various meet-
ings ranging in size and
intimacy, from one-on-ones
with editors in your office
to fashion and features
meetings with up to 40
people. You prefer small
meetings—they tend to be
most efficient—but larger
meetings are an important
time for everyone to get on
the same page.
OUT AND ABOUT
Throughout the day you
will often have meetings
outside of the office, at the
Met or designers’ studios.
Even so, you make a point
of responding quickly to
emails and queries from your
entire Vogue team to keep
things moving forward.
THE “ TAKE
HOME BAG”
You’ll need a system for
staying on top of things
that works for you. You,
for example, have the “take
home bag”: At the end of
each day, the take home
bag is filled with a variety
of things that need your
feedback or approval,
including “the book,” a
mock-up of the issue that
is currently in production.
You go through the
book every night and
comments on it with Post-it
notes. You then go over
your notes with the art
department and editors
the next morning. The take
home bag will also include
drafts of articles for upcom-
ing issues, pitches for future
stories, photographer or
stylist portfolios, invitations,
and scheduling questions.

NEVER RESPOND WITH NUMBERED OR BULLETED LISTS! Instead, always be conversational.
